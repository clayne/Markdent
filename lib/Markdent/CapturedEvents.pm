=head1 DESCRIPTION

This represents a series of captured parser events, and can be used to replay
them with a handle.

=head1 METHODS

Creates a new Markdent::CapturedEvents object.

=head2 $captured->events

Returns the captured events as an array.

=head2 $captured->capture_events(@events)

Captures one or more events.

=head2 $captured->replay_events($handler)

Given an object which does the L<Markdent::Role::Handler> role, this method
will replay all the captured events to that handler.
